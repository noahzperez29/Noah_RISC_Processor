## How it works

This project implements a single-cycle RISC-V processor core supporting a subset of the RV32I base
integer instruction set. Every instruction — fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back —
completes in a single clock cycle.

The core consists of seven modules: an instruction memory (`imem`), a data memory (`dmem`), a register
file (`regfile`), a control unit that decodes instructions and generates control signals, an
immediate generator (`immgen`), an ALU, and a top-level module that wires them together and manages
the program counter.

Because the design only exposes 8 dedicated input pins and 8 dedicated output pins, the internal 32-bit
program counter (`debug_pc`) is exposed externally through a byte-select multiplexer: `ui_in[1:0]`
selects which of the four bytes of `debug_pc` is currently driven onto `uo_out`. Cycling through all
four select values and reassembling the bytes reconstructs the full 32-bit program counter value,
letting you observe the core's execution externally in real time.

Reset is active-low (`rst_n`) at the TT interface and is inverted internally to match the core's
active-high reset convention.

Known limitations: only a subset of RV32I is currently implemented — non-`addi` I-type instructions
and `blt`-style branches are not yet functionally correct in this revision.

## How to test

1. Hold `rst_n` low for at least a few clock cycles, then release it (drive high).
2. Set `ui_in[1:0]` to `00`, `01`, `10`, and `11` in sequence, sampling `uo_out` after each change, to
   read back the four bytes of the program counter (`debug_pc[7:0]`, `debug_pc[15:8]`,
   `debug_pc[23:16]`, `debug_pc[31:24]` respectively).
3. Reassemble the four bytes into a 32-bit value to get the current program counter.
4. Immediately after reset, the reconstructed program counter should read `0`.
5. Clock the design and repeat steps 2-3; the program counter should advance by 4 each cycle for
   sequential instructions, and should jump non-sequentially when the program executes a branch or
   jump instruction, confirming the core is correctly fetching and executing its preloaded program.

## External hardware

No external hardware is required. All inputs and outputs can be driven and observed directly through
the Tiny Tapeout demo board's onboard RP2040 microcontroller.
